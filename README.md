# Python_Cycle-Sheet-Problems
This repository is the compilation of VIT Vellore's Introduction to Python Course - Cycle Sheet Problems. These questions are just meant for practice purpose. I am doing these questions in my first semester of college.

M12_CSQ1 - Write a Python program to calculate the age of a housefly in seconds, given the number of days the housefly lived.

M12_CSQ2 - Milk is collected for sales from nearest ‘n’ farms to the milk booth. Given the amount of milk from ‘n’ farms in liters and ml, write a Python program to compute total quantity of milk in the booth. For example, if milk comes from 3 farms in quantities 2 liters 300 ml, 3 liters 700 ml and 4 liters
600 ml then the total quantity of milk in booth is 10 liters 600 ml.
