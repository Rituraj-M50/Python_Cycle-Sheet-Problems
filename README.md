# Python_Cycle-Sheet-Problems
This repository is the compilation of VIT Vellore's Introduction to Python Course - Cycle Sheet Problems. These questions are just meant for practice purpose. I am doing these questions in my first semester of college.

M12_CSQ1 - Write a Python program to calculate the age of a housefly in seconds, given the number of days the housefly lived.

M12_CSQ2 - Milk is collected for sales from nearest ‘n’ farms to the milk booth. Given the amount of milk from ‘n’ farms in liters and ml, write a Python program to compute total quantity of milk in the booth. For example, if milk comes from 3 farms in quantities 2 liters 300 ml, 3 liters 700 ml and 4 liters
600 ml then the total quantity of milk in booth is 10 liters 600 ml.

M12_CSQ3 - Write a python program for converting the given two-digit number into its corresponding Roman numeral.

M3_CSQ1 - Write a python program to accept the annual income of an employee and display the income tax to be paid at the end of the year according to the following criteria :
Annual income (in Rs) Income Tax:
> 1000000                             4 %
> 500000 and <= 1000000               2 %
<= 500000                             NIL

M3_CSQ2 - One fine day, Mr. X travels to his office by the taxi, a taxi driver charges the bill as follows. Write a Python program to accept the kilometers traveled by Mr. X and calculate his taxi bill.

First 10 Km Rs15/km
Next 90 Km Rs 8/km
After that Rs6/km

M3_CSQ5 - Construct a python program to calculate sum of digits of a given integer number until the sum becomes a single digit number.

M12_CSQ4 - Write a  Python program to input two complex numbers and add the same to produce the result. After producing the result, print the real part and imaginary part separately.

M12_CSQ5 - Write a Python program to convert the given integer to the corresponding binary, octal and hexadecimal values and print the same.

M4_CSQ2 - Write a python program using list to implement reverse polish notation calculator. In reverse polish notation, mathematical expressions are written with the operator following its operands. For example, 3 + 4 becomes 3 4 +. Order of operations is entirely based on the ordering of the operators and operands. To write 3 + (4 ∗ 2), we would write 3 4 2 ∗ + in RPN. The expressions are evaluated from left to right. Evaluate the expression and display the result.
